# Stock Portfolio Code Refactoring

Refactor existing code in the Stock Portfolio Manager to improve maintainability, performance, and adherence to project conventions.

## Context

This is a React 19 + TypeScript application with established patterns for components, hooks, and state management. Refactoring should maintain functionality while improving code quality.

## Refactoring Goals

### 1. Code Quality Improvements

- Eliminate code duplication and extract reusable patterns
- Improve TypeScript type safety and eliminate `any` types
- Enhance error handling and edge case coverage
- Simplify complex component logic

### 2. Architecture Alignment

- Ensure components follow the established atomic design pattern
- Align with project's TypeScript and React conventions
- Improve separation of concerns between UI and business logic
- Optimize component composition and reusability

### 3. Performance Enhancements

- Apply proper memoization strategies
- Optimize state management patterns
- Improve bundle splitting and lazy loading
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders

## Refactoring Patterns

### Component Extraction

```typescript
// Before: Large monolithic component
const StockDashboard = () => {
  // 200+ lines of mixed concerns
};

// After: Composition of focused components
const StockDashboard = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <PortfolioSummary />
      <StockList />
      <PortfolioChart />
    </>
  );
};
```

### Hook Extraction

```typescript
// Before: Component with embedded logic
const StockForm = () => {
  const [stocks, setStocks] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  // Complex state logic...
};

// After: Custom hook for state management
const StockForm = () => {
  const { stocks, loading, addStock, updateStock } = useStockManagement();
  // Clean component logic...
};
```

### Type Safety Improvements

- Replace union types with discriminated unions
- Add proper generic constraints
- Implement runtime type validation
- Use branded types for domain-specific values

## Specific Refactoring Areas

### Data Management

- Extract localStorage operations into utility functions
- Implement proper data validation and sanitization
- Create typed data access layer
- Add error recovery mechanisms

### UI Components

- Extract common UI patterns into reusable components
- Implement proper component composition
- Standardize styling patterns with TailwindCSS
- Improve accessibility implementation

### Business Logic

- Extract portfolio calculations into pure functions
- Implement proper validation schemas
- Create domain-specific utility functions
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Testing Support

- Refactor for better testability
- Reduce component coupling
- Extract pure functions for unit testing
- Improve mock-ability of dependencies

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Identify Refactoring Targets

- Components with high complexity or line count
- Repeated code patterns across the application
- Performance bottlenecks identified through profiling
- Areas with poor test coverage or testability

### 2. Plan Incremental Changes

- Maintain functionality during refactoring
- Use TypeScript to catch breaking changes
- Update tests alongside code changes
- Document architectural decisions

### 3. Validate Improvements

- Ensure all tests pass after refactoring
- Verify performance improvements with benchmarks
- Confirm accessibility requirements are maintained
- Test user workflows end-to-end

## Code Review Focus

### Before/After Comparison

- Highlight specific improvements made
- Demonstrate better type safety
- Show performance optimizations
- Explain architectural benefits

### Backward Compatibility

- Ensure existing functionality is preserved
- Maintain consistent API interfaces
- Update dependent components properly
- Preserve user data and state

Generate specific refactoring recommendations with detailed before/after code examples that demonstrate clear improvements in maintainability and performance.
