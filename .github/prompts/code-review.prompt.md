# Stock Portfolio Code Review

Comprehensive code review for Stock Portfolio Manager components, hooks, and utilities with focus on quality, performance, and maintainability.

## Context

This is a React 19 + TypeScript application following strict coding standards. Code review should ensure adherence to project conventions, performance best practices, and accessibility requirements.

## Review Checklist

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

- [ ] No usage of `any` type or type assertions
- [ ] Proper interface/type naming (PascalCase)
- [ ] Generic types used appropriately
- [ ] Runtime type validation where needed
- [ ] Type-only imports used: `import type { ... }`

### ‚öõÔ∏è React Best Practices

- [ ] Functional components with React.FC typing
- [ ] Proper use of hooks (order, dependencies)
- [ ] Memoization applied strategically (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- [ ] State updates are immutable
- [ ] Side effects properly managed with useEffect
- [ ] Component composition over inheritance

### üé® Styling & UI

- [ ] Consistent with dark theme design system
- [ ] TailwindCSS utility classes used properly
- [ ] Responsive design implemented (mobile-first)
- [ ] Proper spacing using 8px grid system
- [ ] Accessible color contrast ratios
- [ ] Consistent typography and iconography

### üîç Performance Considerations

- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders eliminated
- [ ] Expensive calculations memoized
- [ ] Event handlers properly memoized
- [ ] Bundle size impact considered
- [ ] Lazy loading implemented where appropriate
- [ ] localStorage operations optimized

### üß™ Testing & Quality

- [ ] Unit tests cover critical functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for user flows
- [ ] Accessibility tests included
- [ ] Error scenarios tested
- [ ] Mocks and fixtures are realistic
- [ ] Test descriptions are clear and meaningful

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

- [ ] Proper error boundaries implemented
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Graceful degradation for failures
- [ ] localStorage errors handled
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Network error recovery (if applicable)

### ‚ôø Accessibility

- [ ] Semantic HTML elements used
- [ ] ARIA attributes implemented correctly
- [ ] Keyboard navigation supported
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Focus management and indicators
- [ ] Color is not the only information method

## Code Quality Metrics

### Complexity Analysis

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Should be < 10 per function
- **Component Size**: < 150 lines for UI components
- **Function Length**: < 30 lines per function
- **Nesting Depth**: < 4 levels of indentation

### Maintainability Factors

- **Code Duplication**: Eliminate repeated patterns
- **Naming Clarity**: Self-documenting variable/function names
- **Comment Quality**: Explain "why" not "what"
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal external dependencies

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Bundle Impact**: New code shouldn't increase bundle by >5%
- **Render Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders in profiler
- **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks in component lifecycle
- **localStorage Efficiency**: Debounced writes, compressed data

## Review Focus Areas

### Component Props Interface

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear, typed interface
interface StockFormProps {
  initialStock?: Stock;
  onSubmit: (stock: Stock) => void;
  onCancel: () => void;
  isLoading?: boolean;
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Unclear, untyped props
interface Props {
  data?: any;
  callback?: Function;
}
```

### State Management Patterns

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Immutable updates with proper typing
const updateStock = useCallback((id: string, updates: Partial<Stock>) => {
  setStocks((prev) =>
    prev.map((stock) => (stock.id === id ? { ...stock, ...updates } : stock)),
  );
}, []);

// ‚ùå Bad: Direct state mutation
const updateStock = (id: string, updates: any) => {
  const stock = stocks.find((s) => s.id === id);
  if (stock) {
    Object.assign(stock, updates);
  }
};
```

### Error Handling Implementation

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Comprehensive error handling
const savePortfolio = async (portfolio: Portfolio) => {
  try {
    await localStorage.setItem('portfolio', JSON.stringify(portfolio));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to save portfolio:', error);
    toast.error('Unable to save changes. Please try again.');
    throw new Error('Storage operation failed');
  }
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Silent failures
const savePortfolio = (portfolio: Portfolio) => {
  localStorage.setItem('portfolio', JSON.stringify(portfolio));
};
```

## Security Review

### Input Validation

- [ ] All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] XSS prevention measures in place
- [ ] SQL injection not applicable (localStorage only)
- [ ] File upload security (if applicable)

### Data Protection

- [ ] Sensitive data not logged to console
- [ ] localStorage data is not exposed globally
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Proper data access controls

## Performance Review

### Bundle Analysis

- [ ] Import statements optimized for tree-shaking
- [ ] Dynamic imports used for code splitting
- [ ] External dependencies justified and minimal
- [ ] Dead code elimination verified

### Runtime Performance

- [ ] Component profiling shows acceptable render times
- [ ] Memory leaks prevented with proper cleanup
- [ ] Event listeners properly removed
- [ ] Timers and intervals cleaned up
